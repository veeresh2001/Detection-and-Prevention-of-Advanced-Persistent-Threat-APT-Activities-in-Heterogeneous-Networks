# Detection-and-Prevention-of-Advanced-Persistent-Threat-APT-Activities-in-Heterogeneous-Networks
Detection and Prevention of Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) Activities in Heterogeneous Networks using SIEM and Deep Learning.Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) in IOT based systems has become a vital consideration especially since the quintessential development of IOT based gadgets including small Personal Digital Assistants (PDA) to large computing systems. The stupendous and prolonged presence of such innovations have attracted potential attackers, encouraging them to carry out cyber attacks and data theft. The key objective of this research is to detect and mitigate botnet-based distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks in IoT networks
